/*
 * Using SpirePatch, also known as patching, allows you to insert your own code into the basegame code.
 * It is an extremely powerful and useful tool that can appear complicated at first. If you have no experience with modding StS, and especially
 * with Java, I recommend you skip this for a while until you have a semi-decent grip on things/until you feel like you need to use it.
 * That being said, at the end of the day, it is not very complex once you understand how it works.
 *
 * Keep in mind that every patch is very unique so making a "tutorial class" that goes beyond the basics is a bit difficult,
 * since there are too many unique cases. I'll leave it up to you to experiment and learn what you need for *your own* patch.
 *
 * You will ***NEED*** to follow the official SpirePatch documentation here as you read through this patch.
 * https://github.com/kiooeht/ModTheSpire/wiki/SpirePatch
 * https://github.com/kiooeht/ModTheSpire/wiki/Matcher
 * Comments with quotations are taken from the documentation.
 *
 * This is a good time to Ctrl+Click on AbstractDungeon down there and Ctrl+f for returnRandomRelicKey() - that is the method that we will be patching.
 * Have a read through it's code. returnRandomRelicKey() is a method that is passed a rarity (relic tier) and returns the first relic
 * from the appropriate pool of that rarity (which are pre-shuffled), as well as removing it from the relic pool so that you never get it again.
 *
 * This is used whenever any combat gives you a relic reward - it is how the game grabs a random relic.
 * (On a sidenote returnEndRandomRelicKey() on the other hand returns the *last* relic form the same list - this is used for shops.)
 * That way visiting a shop doesn't change what relics you would get/see otherwise.
 *
 * Now that we understand how that method works - This patch will do the following:
 * We will insert our piece of code above the line "return !RelicLibrary.getRelic(retVal).canSpawn() ? returnEndRandomRelicKey(tier) : retVal;"
 * which is at the very end of the method. (If you read through the official documentation, you will also know that you can simply use a postfix patch to do that.)
 * Have a read through the documentation as to their differences - they all have their pros and cons.
 * For example postfix patches can't use @ByRef and doesn't have localvars. On the other hand, instead of needing to use SpireReturn they can just
 * put a return value in their patched method, and they can also be passed the original return value of the patched method.
 *
 * *NEVER USE REPLACE PATCHES. DON'T REPLACE GAME FILES EITHER (by putting a file with the same name in the same location as a basegame one).*
 * *NEVER USE REPLACE PATCHES. DON'T REPLACE GAME FILES EITHER (by putting a file with the same name in the same location as a basegame one).*
 * *NEVER USE REPLACE PATCHES. DON'T REPLACE GAME FILES EITHER (by putting a file with the same name in the same location as a basegame one).*
 * *NEVER USE REPLACE PATCHES. DON'T REPLACE GAME FILES EITHER (by putting a file with the same name in the same location as a basegame one).*
 * *NEVER USE REPLACE PATCHES. DON'T REPLACE GAME FILES EITHER (by putting a file with the same name in the same location as a basegame one).*
 * *NEVER USE REPLACE PATCHES. DON'T REPLACE GAME FILES EITHER (by putting a file with the same name in the same location as a basegame one).*
 *
 * So:
 * We will insert our piece of code above the line "return !RelicLibrary.getRelic(retVal).canSpawn() ? returnEndRandomRelicKey(tier) : retVal;"
 * We will the put in a logger inside that prints out the the value of the local variable "retVal" of that method.
 * That's about it.
 *
 * Let's get to it!

        Now let's imagine for a second that there were two methods named returnRandomRelicKey()

        and a fictional one - "String returnRandomRelicKey(RelicTier tier, LandingSound sound)" - that grabs a relic of a specific tier AND with a specific landing sound.
        How would we tell the code which of the two methods to put our patch in? We use paramtypez (read the docs too they have a good example!)
        Let's say we wanted to patch the second fictional one - we would add

        // However you wouldn't get anchor. You would get the standard relic roll.
        // The reason behind that is because by default, in patches, all variables are passed by Value, not by Reference.
        // (You can google what this means in java if you don't understand).
        // This means that while we can change retVal within our own method, it won't change in the actual, original basegame method.
        // If you want to do that, you'll need to use @byRef on the variable you want to change - this makes it get passed by reference.

             * Did you know that the third option is *actually* on a completely different line than the first one?
             * Decompiling the code with a different decompiler shows that the last line is actually a lot more like this:
             *
             * if (!RelicLibrary.getRelic(retVal).canSpawn()) {

             *  On a sidenote, you should enable debug lines in intelliJ both for bugfixing and seeing what thing is *really* on what line
             *  To do so:
             * 1. Ctrl+Shift+A
